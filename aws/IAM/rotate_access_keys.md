**How do you rotate access keys for IAM users, and why is key rotation important?**

Create a **New Access Key:**

Sign in to the **AWS Management Console.**

Navigate to the **IAM service.**

Select the **IAM user** for whom you want to rotate the access key.

Go to the **"Security credentials"** tab.

Click on **"Create access key"** to generate a new access key pair (Access Key ID and Secret Access Key).

**Update Applications:**
```Update any applications, scripts, or services using the old access key with the new access key.
Ensure that the new access key is working correctly before deactivating the old one.
```
**Deactivate the Old Access Key:**
In the IAM console, go back to the ***"Security credentials"*** tab for the user.
Find the old access key and click on **"Make inactive."**

**Delete the Old Access Key:**
Once you have verified that the new access key is working and no longer need the old key, delete the old access key.
This can be done by selecting the old access key and clicking **"Delete."**

**Why Key Rotation is Important**

***Enhances Security:***
Regularly rotating access keys reduces the risk of key compromise.
If an access key is compromised, rotating keys limits the potential damage by ensuring that old keys are quickly deactivated.

***Minimizes Risk of Unauthorized Access:***
Keys that are regularly rotated are less likely to be exposed for extended periods.
Regular key rotation helps ensure that any potential unauthorized access can be mitigated quickly.

***Compliance:***
Many security standards and regulations require regular key rotation as part of best practices for security management.
Adhering to these standards helps maintain compliance with industry regulations.
Limits the Impact of Key Exposure:

***Even if an access key is inadvertently exposed, regular rotation limits the window during which the key can be misused.***
