Explain the structure of an S3 object's URL (Uniform Resource Locator)

The structure of an S3 object's URL is designed to uniquely identify and access objects stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. 

The URL typically follows this format:
``https://rahul_bucket.s3.region.amazonaws.com/object-key``

Here's a breakdown of each component:

1. Protocol: https://
Specifies the protocol used to access the resource, which is HTTPS for secure access.

------------------------------------
2. Bucket Name: bucket-name
The name of the S3 bucket where the object is stored.

------------------------------------
3. S3 Service: s3
Indicates that the resource is stored in Amazon S3.

------------------------------------
4. Region: region
Specifies the AWS region where the bucket is located. This might be omitted if the bucket is in the default region.

------------------------------------
5. Domain: amazonaws.com
The domain name for AWS services.

------------------------------------
5. Object Key: object-key
The unique identifier for the object within the bucket. This could include the file name and any nested path.

The structure of an S3 object's URL is designed to uniquely identify and access objects stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. The URL typically follows this format:

``https://bucket-name.s3.region.amazonaws.com/object-key``

Here's a breakdown of each component:
---------------------------------------------------------
Protocol: https://

Bucket Name: bucket-name

The name of the S3 bucket where the object is stored.
S3 Service: s3

Indicates that the resource is stored in Amazon S3.
Region: region

Specifies the AWS region where the bucket is located. This might be omitted if the bucket is in the default region.
Domain: amazonaws.com

The domain name for AWS services.
Object Key: object-key

--------------------------------------------------------
**The unique identifier for the object within the bucket. This could include the file name and any nested path.
For example, an S3 object stored in the bucket my-bucket in the us-west-2 region with the key images/photo.jpg would have a URL like:**

``https://my-bucket.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/photo.jpg``

-------------------------------------



***Important Points:***

Not all S3 objects are publicly accessible through a URL. Public access needs to be configured for the bucket or object for the URL to work directly in a web browser.
The AWS SDKs and tools you use might prefer one format over the other.
